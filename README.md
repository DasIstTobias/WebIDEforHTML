# Web IDE for HTML
A simple Web IDE for Programming with HTML, CSS and JS. It supports a Code Editor with syntax highlighting, a Javascript Console and a live Preview of the Page. These individual parts of the Web IDE can be resized to suit your needs.

Everything is saved in the localStorage of your Browser.

If you finished your project, you can export single files or all in one as a ZIP-File. You are also able to import Files (via a Button or Drag-and-Drop).
